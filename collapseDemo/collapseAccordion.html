                    You begin to cherish yourself only when you begin to cherish your originality. It seems the plum fruit once said, “Just because a banana lover came by, I converted myself into a banana. Unfortunately, his taste changed after a few months and so I became an orange. When he said I was bitter, I became an apple, but he went in search of grapes. Yielding to the opinions of so many people, I have changed so many times that I no more know who I am. How much I wish I had remained a plum and waited for a plum lover.”

                    Dream we must, that all of us know. What is significant is that all great dreamers processed great dreams not necessarily during the best of times, but also during the toughtest of times. Dream they did, and on the sheer strength of their dreams – organisations, nations and humanity as a whole, stood up. Leaders must be dreamers. Let us dream, and on the sheer strength of our dreams, let us get the world to stand up.

                    The more and more you discriminate between the lower and the higher, and embrace the higher… your life will graduate into a state of selflessness. You will begin to think beyond yourself. It is not that you won't have goals any more, but your goals will be more in the larger interest rather than being merely self-centred. This very progression is spiritual evolution…
